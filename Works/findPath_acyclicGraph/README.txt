A good tool to find the shortest path, the longest path and the number of paths in a directed acyclic graph.



Defination of "Directed Acyclic Graphs": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph



---------

User Case

---------



Prepare the java environment and run the "find_path".



Change the graph file "graph.txt" to customize your own directed acyclic graph.



Compile and run

---------------



Install java



In the directory "findPath_acyclicGraph": Use the command "javac find_path.java" to compile.



In the same directory: Use the command "java find_path" to run the program.



Customizing the "graph.txt" file

--------------------------------



First line: Enter the number of the nodes that will exsit in the graph.



Second line: Enter the number of the edges that will exsit in the graph.



The rest lins: Use the format "'start node',space,'end node'" to create the directed edges for the graph.
