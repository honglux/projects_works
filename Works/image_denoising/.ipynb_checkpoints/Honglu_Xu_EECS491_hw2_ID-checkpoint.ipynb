However, if we do so for a gray scaled image, the image will lost a lot of information after convertion. I tried another way, that convert all the gray scaled pixels into float numbers between the -1, 1. In that way, we can keep stall keep the relatrion between all the pixels, and after we all done, we can convert the pixels back without lossing much information. However, this is still a very tedious way to achieve. My last version is, we can still use the oringinal gray scale to do the denoise the function. Since the correction method for de-niosing is just to flip the pixels by \"image_filp_copy[dE < 0] *= -1\" this function, we can use change the pixels from 0~255 to -127~127. In That way, we can still flip the pixels in a gray scale."

Compared to the change from -127 to 127, the change for -2 is really small. Thus, it will still be a noise piexl after we flipped it, this is not efficient."
