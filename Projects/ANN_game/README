-----------------------------------------------------------
Apply Artificial Neural Networks on AIs to Play Video Games
-----------------------------------------------------------

Packages used
-------------
pygame, random, time, numpy, PIL, datetime, os, pgmpy, keras

User Case
---------
To run the game, just simply use "Python Snake.py" in "src" folder, but you need all the needed packages to be installed with your python.

All the other information will be talked in PDF files or Jupyter Notebook files, the Jupyter Notebook files contains the GIFs with short animation.

The logical part will be talked in "Honglu_Xu_EECS491_FP.pdf" and "Honglu_Xu_EECS491_FP.ipynb"
The vision part will be talked in "Honglu_Xu_EECS531_FP.pdf" and "Honglu_Xu_EECS531_FP.ipynb"

Methods Used
------------
Logical part: random input, decision tree, alpha-beta algorithm, artificial neural networks(dense).
Vision part: feature detection, artificial neural networks (dense), artificial neural networks (2d convolution)
