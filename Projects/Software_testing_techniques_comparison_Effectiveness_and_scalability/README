General
-------
In this project, we intend to compare software testing tools with our focus on comparing their effectiveness for revealing faults and their scalability. Our aim is to compare some testing tools and help software developers to select one or multiple performant and compatible software testing tools for testing. There are many methods and techniques needed to achieve this goal, and we will discuss these features in our paper.
	The three Testing tools are: Evosuite, CodePro and Randoop.

File Directions
--------------
1.Final Report:
The final report is located in the same directory, named "FinalReport.pdf".

2. Program Code:
We have implemented three our own testing samples for the experiment. They are located at the folder "program_code".

3. Data Sets:
All the test cases that generated by these three test generator tools will be our data sets. However, for some reason, not all the test cases are deliverable.
	Evosuite's test cases are located at folder "data_sets/Evosuite_test". These files will mostly (but not all) cover the module "portal-service" in the project "liferay-6.0.6-master". It will take nearly 72 hours to use the Evosuite to generate all the test cases in this project, so we decided to prick some typical samples for generation.
	CodePro's test cases are located at the folder "data_sets/CodePro_test". It is also partially covering the module "portal-service". In case we need to compare the same class for control variable method.
	Randoop's test cases are not deviverabel. All the test cases Randoop generated will use the same file name and the same class name, and there are no file structures for the generation. Thus, it is nearly inpossibile to collect and all the test cases generated by Randoop.
